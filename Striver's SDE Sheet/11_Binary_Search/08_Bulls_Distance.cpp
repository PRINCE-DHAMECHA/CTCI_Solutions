//& There is a new barn with N stalls and C cows. The stalls are located on a straight line at positions x1,â€¦.,xN (0 <= xi <= 1,000,000,000). We want to assign the cows to the stalls, such that the minimum distance between any two of them is as large as possible. What is the largest minimum distance?

//* Approach will be same as previous problem
//* We first find search space then try to reduce it to get answer using binary search
//* Search space will be min= min possible gap, max= last- first (in sorted)

//* If we can have k cows in given minimum distance i.e. a
